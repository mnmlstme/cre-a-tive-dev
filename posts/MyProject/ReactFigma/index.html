<p>This workbook demonstrates how we can use React to build
components and frames in Figma. The focus is on using React
as the <strong data-mark-around="**">Single Source of Truth</strong> for a design system,
including components, styles, and design tokens.</p>

<p>We will build React components in this workbook and then
use <a href="https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma">react-figma</a>
to inject them into a Figma file as components.
This will allow us to prove out the component APIs and ensure the
Figma components are completely specified.</p>

<kram-scene scene="1" language="jsx"><h1>A Simple <code data-mark-around="`">Tag</code> Component</h1>

<p>Whenever we say &ldquo;component&rdquo;, it may be unclear whether we&rsquo;re talking
about a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html">React component</a> or a
<a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-components-in-Figma">Figma component</a>.
This can cause a good deal of confusion and miscommunication between Design and Engineering
teams.</p>

<p>Here we&rsquo;re taking a more abstract and implementation-dependent approach. We are not developing
production-ready React components. We are developing a <em data-mark-around="_">specification</em> or <em data-mark-around="_">prototype</em>
for each of the components.</p>

<p>The choice of React for this representation is somewhat arbitrary.
We need a way to describe a design which can have multiple implementations on various platforms,
in such a way that abstracts out the platform dependencies and focuses on what&rsquo;s common between them.
React is flexible enough, and there is tooling available to render to the web, native iOS/Android, as well as
Figma (through <code data-mark-around="`">react-figma</code>).</p>
